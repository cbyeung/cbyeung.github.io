It has been almost one year (267 days if my lab book is to be trusted) since I last fabricated a fibrin clot *in vitro*. Time to don my gloves and goggles and see what one year of refrigeration has done to my reagents and what one year of inactivity has done to my skills in the wet lab.

I began by making a clot with 0.5 un/mL thrombin, the main purpose of which was to validate both the integrity of my -20&deg;C-frozen reagents as well as my clot-making techniques; specifically, whether I can reproduce the clot density and porosity that I saw last year.

Here's the result:

Now compare and contrast this with one I made last year, with the same (though arguably fresher) reagents at identical concentrations:

The fibrin to my eyes has retained a similar structure. The fibrils are brightly fluorescent and well-defined---fibrils with a beaten-up appearance are often characteristic of reagents past their useful lives. It is astonishing how long proteins can remain viable if refrigerated properly.

The pores in figure 1 are ever-so slightly larger than those in figure 2. This being the case, I fashioned another series of clots out of 0.1 un/mL, 0.5 un/mL and 1.0 un/mL thrombin. Which was just as well considering the rather surprising results.

These images sounded a siren in my head. Progressively higher concentrations of thrombin should produce fibrin clots with dramatically higher densities and lower porosities, as [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-19-fabricating-and-3d-printing-fibrin-clots-to-understand-sonothrombolysis.md %}) shows. Seen here, the 0.1 and 1.0 un/mL clots have similar densities; meanwhile the 0.5 un/mL clot turns out to be the densest.

This prompted me to revisit some of the earlier confocal micrographs I imaged last year. I will not inflict them on you, but suffice it to say, I discovered there was more variability...
