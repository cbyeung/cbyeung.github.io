### *Acoustics: An Introduction to its Physical Principles and Applications* by Allan D. Pierce (1989)
**pp 8** Conservation of mass in a fluid: $$\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho v)=0$$.

**pp 11** Euler's equation of motion for a fluid: $$\rho\frac{Dv}{Dt}=-\nabla p$$, means acceleration points in the direction of decreasing pressure.

**pp 13** Sound is an adiabatic ($$\frac{Ds}{Dt}=0$$) rather than isothermal ($$\nabla^2T=0$$) process.

### *The Acoustic Bubble* by T.G. Leighton (1994)
**pp 302** The simplest nonlinear equation of motion for a forced, spherically-pulsating bubble in an incompressible, *viscous* liquid, is the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.

**pp 304** The resultant net effect of viscosity stresses per unit volume at any point internal to the fluid is zero, but the stresses themselves may be nonzero; viscous effects manifest themselves through the boundary condition.

**pp 305** The Rayleigh-Plesset equation:

$$\begin{equation*}
R\ddot{R}+\frac{3\dot{R}^2}{2} = \frac{1}{\rho}\left\{ \left( p_0+\frac{2\sigma}{R_0}-p_v \right)\left( \frac{R_0}{R} \right)^{3\kappa}+p_v-\frac{2\sigma}{R}-\frac{4\eta\dot{R}}{R}-p_0-P(t) \right\}.
\end{equation*}$$

**pp 311** A small change in the parameters ($$P_\text{input amplitude}$$, $$R_0$$, $$\omega$$) of Rayleigh-Plesset could bring about dramatic changes in the radius-time curve.
