Here are the questions I asked Irina and her responses:

**Q1** Why do my clots look like spider webs rather than ropes? (Show Irina my images, 3D prints and a dummy slide.)

**A1** Nail polish absorbs water. My samples could be dessicated. Use silicon grease instead, and only apply it to the open sides, i.e. the top and bottom. The sides on double-sided tape are already sealed.

**Q2** Should clots be isotropic (*in vivo* and *in vitro*)? My fibrils look thicker along the z-axis.

**A2** Real clots in human bodies should be isotropic. Irina thinks the most likely possibility is that despite the high vertical resolution I use, there is still some smearing in the z-direction inherent to the optics. Software could also play a part---Irina uses Volocity, which she says is expensive. Carr maintains that the geometry (in particular the small z-height) of the slide chamber and the negative charge of glass could play a role, though Irina thinks away from the boundaries these should have little impact on clot structure.

**Q3** (Why) is dialysis of fibrinogen with NaCl-Tris buffer really necessary? How can fibrinogen be protected from heat?

**A3** Dialysis is necessary because the buffer in the stock may not be correct. Irina dialyses at 4&deg;C rather than room temperature, overnight. This could also relate to **Q1**.

**Q4** What is the physiological range of clot densities in the human body, i.e. are my sample images representative of clinical conditions?

**A4** In a human body there is much more variation, even in a single thrombus. For instance in the vicinity of a platelet the concentration of thrombin may be higher than it is farther away. Fibrin therefore forms bundles. Real thrombi do not have the homogeneity of my samples.
