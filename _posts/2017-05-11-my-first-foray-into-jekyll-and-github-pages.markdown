I can find this post in my `_posts` directory. I can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server at `localhost:4000` and auto-regenerates my site when any file (except `_config.yml`) is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
#=> some Ruby code from Jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
def add(m,n):
  p = m + n
  return p
# some silly python code
{% endhighlight %}

Picture of a pretty HondaJet:

Do tables work?

| time | squared | capacity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | yes |
| 1 | 1 | yes |
| 2 | 4 | no |
| 3 | 9 | no |
| 4 | 16 | maybe |
{:.table}

No, unfortunately not as is. Update: after adding a `.table` style to `_base.scss`, it now works perfectly. Note: in the command line, locate gems with `bundle show [gem_name]`.

Some `MathJax`? Try this on for size: $$x^2$$. Or this?

\\[\sin{\theta} = \frac{e^{ix}-e^{-ix}}{2i}.\\]
